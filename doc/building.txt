How to use building system
==========================

The answer is very simple: goto project root and run
"./build (modules-list-you-want-to-build)"

"./build --help" will show you all available modules

Internal structure of building system
=====================================

Building system consists of two layers (tier1 and tier2).

Tier1 is ./build script. It consumes the modules.list file,
And the list of modules to build from command line.

It resolves intermodular dependencies and runs Tier2
Building system (by recipes from modules.list)

Tier2 are individual build scripts from ./src/.../
They are usually make's and they are making individual modules.

Dependencies
============

Intermodular dependencies are handled by tier2 building system.
And cross-modular by tier1.

Circular cross-modular dependencies are not allowed.
And all cross-modular dependencies must be specified explicitly in modules.list
